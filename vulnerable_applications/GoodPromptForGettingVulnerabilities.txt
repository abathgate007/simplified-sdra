"Assume the role of a senior penetration tester creating a complete audit checklist for the deliberately vulnerable application, [Application Name].
Your task is to generate a comprehensive and exhaustive list of every known vulnerability for this application. Your analysis must be meticulous.
Include not only the most common vulnerabilities (like SQLi and XSS) but also more nuanced and secondary issues, such as:
Security Misconfigurations
Information Disclosure / Verbose Errors
Broken Access Control (IDOR)
Insecure File Handling (Uploads, Traversal)
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
Weak Session Management
Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards
Any other known weaknesses.
The goal is to create a complete list suitable for a formal security test plan. Do not summarize or omit less critical findings.
Please format the final output as a JSON array using the following structure: [ { "id": "...", "title": "...", "category": "...", "cwe": "...", "mitigation": "..." } ]"
