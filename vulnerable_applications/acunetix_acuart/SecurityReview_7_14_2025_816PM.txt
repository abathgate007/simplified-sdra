# Security Design Review for AcuArt Online Gallery Platform

## Architectural Weaknesses and Attack Surfaces

### 1. Authentication and Session Management
- **Weakness**: Direct SQL concatenation in user registration (`$query = "INSERT INTO users (username, email, password) VALUES ('$username', '$email', '$password')"`)
- **Impact**: SQL injection vulnerability
- **Attack Surface**: All authentication endpoints
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Use prepared statements with parameterized queries
  - Implement a modern authentication framework (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect)
  - Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication

### 2. File Upload Security
- **Weakness**: Direct file upload to filesystem without proper validation (`move_uploaded_file($image_file['tmp_name'], $image_path)`)
- **Impact**: Potential for malicious file uploads leading to RCE or XSS
- **Attack Surface**: Artist portfolio upload functionality
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement strict file type validation (whitelist approach)
  - Store files outside web root or use object storage
  - Scan files for malware before processing
  - Rename uploaded files to prevent path traversal

### 3. Data Protection
- **Weakness**: Plaintext password storage in example code
- **Impact**: Credential compromise if database is breached
- **Attack Surface**: User database
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use strong, modern hashing (Argon2id, bcrypt, PBKDF2)
  - Implement proper key management for encryption
  - Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted at rest

### 4. API Security
- **Weakness**: No detailed specification of API authentication/authorization
- **Impact**: Potential API abuse and data leakage
- **Attack Surface**: RESTful API endpoints
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement OAuth 2.0 with proper scopes
  - Enforce strict rate limiting
  - Validate all API inputs/outputs
  - Use API gateways for additional security controls

### 5. Payment Processing
- **Weakness**: No details on PCI DSS implementation
- **Impact**: Payment data compromise
- **Attack Surface**: Checkout process
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use tokenization for payment processing
  - Ensure full PCI DSS compliance
  - Implement strong fraud detection
  - Consider using a certified payment processor

### 6. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Weakness**: No output encoding shown in comment/blog systems
- **Impact**: Stored and reflected XSS vulnerabilities
- **Attack Surface**: Comment systems, blog posts, artwork descriptions
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement strict output encoding
  - Use Content Security Policy (CSP)
  - Sanitize all user-generated content

### 7. Business Logic Flaws
- **Weakness**: No price validation in shopping cart example
- **Impact**: Potential for price manipulation
- **Attack Surface**: Cart and checkout process
- **Mitigation**:
  - Validate all prices server-side
  - Implement business logic validation layer
  - Use cryptographic signatures for critical transactions

## Recommended Security Enhancements

### Architectural Improvements
1. **Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF)** to protect against common web attacks
2. **Adopt a Zero Trust Architecture** for internal communications
3. **Separate microservices** for critical functions (auth, payments, uploads)
4. **Implement proper logging and monitoring** with SIEM integration

### Technical Implementation
1. **Replace direct SQL with ORM** (e.g., Doctrine, Eloquent) or prepared statements
2. **Implement proper CSRF protection** for all state-changing operations
3. **Add security headers** (HSTS, X-Frame-Options, CSP)
4. **Implement proper CORS policies** for API endpoints
5. **Use JWT with short expiration** for API authentication

### Operational Security
1. **Regular penetration testing** and code reviews
2. **Automated security scanning** in CI/CD pipeline
3. **Security training** for developers on OWASP Top 10
4. **Incident response plan** for security breaches

### Data Protection
1. **Implement field-level encryption** for sensitive data
2. **Pseudonymize/anonymize** data where possible
3. **Regular data purging** per retention policies
4. **Database activity monitoring** for sensitive tables

## Critical Areas Requiring Immediate Attention

1. **SQL Injection Vulnerabilities**: The direct SQL concatenation patterns shown in multiple examples are critical risks that must be addressed immediately.

2. **Authentication Security**: The current authentication implementation needs hardening with modern protocols and proper password handling.

3. **File Upload Security**: The artwork upload functionality presents a significant attack vector that needs proper validation and security controls.

4. **Payment Security**: While mentioned as PCI DSS compliant, the implementation details need verification to ensure proper handling of payment data.

This platform has significant security risks that should be addressed before production deployment, particularly around input validation, authentication, and file handling. A comprehensive security review with penetration testing is strongly recommended.
