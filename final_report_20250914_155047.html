I can generate a complete, polished Security Design Review Report once I have your artifacts (annotated DFDs, trust boundaries, STRIDE matrix, DREAD analysis, and mitigations). If you can paste or attach them, I’ll populate the report with concrete content.

In the meantime, here is a precise, ready-to-fill report template aligned to your artifacts. You can drop your content into the marked sections, and I can finalize it on your next message.

- Data classification per flow/data store (e.g., Public/Internal/Confidential/Restricted):
- Crown jewels and single points of failure:

6) Trust Boundaries and Attack Surface
- Trust boundaries (TB-1..n) with brief definitions:
- Attack surface elements by boundary (external interfaces, admin planes, supply chain, CI/CD, secrets, 3rd-party APIs):
- Entry points and authentication posture at each boundary:
- Implicit trust/privilege assumptions:

7) Threat Modeling Summary (based on your STRIDE matrix)
- Coverage summary: elements analyzed, threats identified, mitigated vs. open:
- STRIDE by element (roll-up):
  - Spoofing: [count], key open items:

  - Repudiation: [count], key open items:
  - Information disclosure: [count], key open items:
  - Denial of service: [count], key open items:
  - Elevation of privilege: [count], key open items:
- Abuse cases and plausible attacker profiles:
- Cross-boundary threat hotspots:

8) Risk Assessment (based on your DREAD analysis)
- Scoring approach and scale used (note any deviations from standard):
- Portfolio risk summary:
  - High risks: [count]
  - Medium risks: [count]
  - Low risks: [count]
- Top risks by DREAD score:
  - [ID/Title] — D:R:E:A:D = [x/x/x/x/x] — Score: [n] — Severity: [H/M/L]
- Sensitivity analysis (key drivers of risk: exploitability, affected users, detection, etc.):

9) Key Findings
For each finding, include the following:
- ID and Title:
- Affected elements (DFD refs, trust boundaries, assets):
- Threat category (STRIDE) and attack path:
- Description and evidence (diagram refs, config notes):
- Impact (business and technical), data at risk, blast radius:
- Likelihood and DREAD breakdown (D, R, E, A, D) with total and severity:
- Preconditions and dependencies:
- Proposed mitigation(s) and design alternatives:
- Residual risk after mitigation:
- Owner, target date, status:
- Validation plan (how we will verify mitigation):

10) Mitigations and Design Changes
- Implemented mitigations (mapped to findings):
- Planned mitigations with timelines:
- Defense-in-depth coverage (prevent/detect/respond):
- Changes to authentication, authorization, crypto, input validation, logging, availability controls:
- Hardening baselines and configuration standards adopted:
- Gaps requiring product/infra changes or vendor engagement:

11) Residual Risk and Risk Acceptance
- Residual risks by severity after mitigations:
- Justification for acceptances (business rationale, compensating controls, time-bounded):
- Risk owners and review/renewal dates:
- Sunset criteria or triggers for re-review:

12) Security Requirements and Control Mapping
- Mapped requirements (e.g., ISO 27001, NIST 800-53, SOC 2, PCI DSS) with coverage notes:
- Control gaps and planned remediation:
- Privacy requirements (data minimization, retention, DSAR, regional residency):

13) Validation and Test Plan
- Security testing to execute:
  - Threat-driven test cases aligned to top findings
  - Penetration testing scope and schedule
  - Secure code review/static/dynamic analysis
  - Fuzzing and negative testing of parsers/protocols
  - Secrets scanning/SBOM and dependency risk checks
  - Chaos/DoS resilience tests and capacity limits
- Monitoring and alerting validation (detections for abuse cases):
- Success criteria and exit gates:

14) Operational Security Considerations
- Identity and access management (least privilege, break-glass, admin plane isolation):
- Secrets management (storage, rotation, just-in-time access):
- Cryptography (algorithms, key sizes, KMS/HSM usage, lifecycle):
- Logging and telemetry (content, retention, protection, privacy):
- Patch and vulnerability management (SLA, third-party libraries, OS images):
- Backup and recovery (RPO/RTO, immutable backups, test cadence):
- Change management and deployment safeguards (approvals, rollbacks, canaries):
- Incident response playbooks (runbooks, contacts, drills):
- Multi-tenant isolation and noisy neighbor protections (if applicable):

15) Open Issues and Action Items
- [ID] [Action] — Owner — Due — Status — Dependency
- …

16) Decision Log
- [Date] [Decision] [Context/Alternatives] [Rationale] [Impacts]

17) Appendices
- A: Annotated DFDs with element IDs and trust boundaries
- B: STRIDE matrix (full detail)
- C: DREAD worksheets and scoring rubric
- D: Mitigations evidence (configs, policies, diagrams)
- E: Glossary and abbreviations

How to proceed
- Option A: Paste or attach your artifacts, and I’ll produce a filled report with prioritized findings, risk summaries, and concrete mitigations.
- Option B: If sharing is not possible, provide brief summaries:
  - DFD elements and trust boundaries
  - STRIDE matrix highlights (top threats per element)
  - DREAD scores for top 10–15 threats
  - Current and proposed mitigations
  - Any constraints/assumptions
I will then generate the complete report.
